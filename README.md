## Project Overview

This repository contains my End-to-End Power BI Dashboard Project, It demonstrate advanced skills in data analysis, modeling, and visualization using Power Query, DAX, and Power BI Service.

The project represents a complete data analytics workflow, from data extraction and transformation to data modeling, DAX implementation, and dashboard design, built entirely in Microsoft Power BI.

Its core focus is on delivering real-world business insights, interactive visualizations, and AI-assisted report development for modern data-driven decision-making.

## Project Highlights

**Complete Dashboard Development**

Designed and developed the dashboard from raw data to final visualization, ensuring clarity, interactivity, and professional presentation.

**Data Transformation Through Power Query**

Cleaned and structured raw datasets by merging, shaping, and creating custom date tables, maintaining proper relationships between dimension and fact tables.

**Advanced DAX Formulas**

Implemented dynamic measures like MTD, QTD, YTD, and LY using key DAX functions such as CALCULATE, FILTER, and Time Intelligence formulas for accurate performance tracking.

**Professional Dashboard Design**

Focused on user experience (UX) through consistent color themes, rounded visuals, shadows, icons, and responsive layouts for improved readability.

**Interactive Reporting**

Added slicers, drill-downs, and visual interactions to allow dynamic exploration by region, product, and time period.

**Publishing & Sharing**

Published the final dashboard to Power BI Service, created embed links, and configured access permissions for seamless collaboration.
